        Perhaps you’ve found yourself drinking, eating, using substances, or engaging in damaging behaviors more frequently than you ever intended. Maybe the impact is subtle—your routines feel off, your relationships strained, or your peace disturbed. Or maybe it’s more severe, and life as you know it feels like it’s slipping out of control.
